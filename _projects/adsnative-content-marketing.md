## Finding a happy medium
AdsNative began 2014 as a native ad platform targeting premium publishers, enabling them to sell placements direct to advertisers. We saw enormous opportunity in growing into a fully featured [SSP (Supply Side Platform)](http://digiday.com/platforms/wtf-supply-side-platform/), and connecting small and mid-sized publishers to a broad range of advertising partners, including brands and ad networks.

This broad set of ad inventory allowed us to easily find matches that met a publishers' editorial standards and provided incremental revenue, helping wean them off pesky banner ads.

## Content feedback widget

We begin working on improvements to our in-feed widget, giving readers a way to submit feedback on the quality of native advertising, and flag content that they feel doesnâ€™t belong on a publishers' site, improving trust and relevance, with additional revenue as a secondary benefit.

## What I learned

### About content marketing as an industry
Content marketing still isn't a complete replacement for display ads on the web, but until a better monetization model exists, there's still a huge opportunity to improve the quality of sponsored content.
