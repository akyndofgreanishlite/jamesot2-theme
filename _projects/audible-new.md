#### Client Description
Audible is the leading audiobook subscription service, with customers listening to more than a billion hours annually. As part of Amazon…

I joined Audible as a Product Designer in Spring 2016, focusing on improving the content discovery experience. Over the following year, I worked on search suggestions & results, category, and product detail pages. 

Something about qualitative (in-person) testing, implementation, and multi-variant testing (rollout).

## User Acquisition
When I first joined Audible, the web team was working to map and improve the user acquisition experience. 

[Referencing past research, we created a customer journey map, and worked with marketing to pull relevant metrics around browsing behavior, including page views, check-out rates, and listening completion.]

{% include image.html fig_class="p-0 outlined" project='audible' img_src='simple-user-flow' fig_cap='The existing content-first acquisition flow we used as a starting point for testing' %}

Through interviews and customer usage metrics gathered, we found that:

- Audible’s subscription model did't match with all-you-can-eat streaming models services familiar to consumers 
- Audiobooks as a medium did't have a reputation as a high fidelity listening experience
- 70% of new customers choosing content before paying for a membership
- Familiar Author, Narrator, and Genre were top factors in choosing a first title when browsing
- Author, Series, and Curated Collections were top performers for search
- Audio sample, Publisher summary, and Top user reviews were important in making a final decision

Ultimately, familiar content or personalities were key sales drivers, and led us to believe that improving the content discovery experience would lead to higher trial take rates rather than focusing on membership benefits alone.
