## Background

## Research

We met with Alloy's leadership and copywriter, gaining an understanding of what they wanted to communicate about themselves as a company, and what amount of content would be realistic to commit to for each project. That research highlighted that the case studies needed to be flexible enough to showcase their best work, regardless of whether they were involved from start to finish, or only helped during initial concepting or stress testing.

They also were recruiting heavily at the time, and wanted to highlight their culture as diverse in skill sets as it was backgrounds & interests outside of the workplace.

## Iterating toward a solution

After chatting with the team, we established the two primary goals of highlighting new work & new partnerships, with potential clients as the audience, and recruiting engineers for their quickly growing studio.

We first worked through an content inventory of Alloy's current site, and worked with their copywriter to get agreement on what would be moved, and what would be left behind. I then placed those pieces in an information architecture draft, that would support and inform design concepts we later presented. We also presented multiple concepts for how their brand would be applied to their new marketing site, with my concept emphasizing the "precision engineering" aspect of the Alloy brand shown below.

## Just the highlights

This homepage concept clearly calls out Alloy’s mission & services, recent projects, and job openings with just the right amount of content visible for new clients or future Alloy employees to quickly find what they’re looking for.

## Flexible case studies

Alloy needed a case study page that would show off the best of each project, while being flexible enough to look great regardless of how much content they had available at the time.

There's a strong sense of camaraderie at Alloy, and we needed to show that this engineering team was made up of a diverse group of people, clearly invested in balancing their passion for good product engineering and interests outside of work. -->

Arturo wanted a place to show off current employees and alumni, and give a voice to the company, and speak to where they fit within the broader product development industry. -->
